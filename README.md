## Summary

SPACE-OUT is my final solo project for module three at the Turing School of Software & Design.  This app is a database of planets in our solar-system (pluto included).  SPACE-OUT pulls from a custom [Google Sheets to API converter](https://sheety.co) which I composed in [this spreadsheet](https://tinyurl.com/yynlwpc7).  The homepage provides links in the dropdown menu to the left, and in the planet images.  Each link will take you to that planet's page, displaying relevant information.  Additionally, a user view some personalized information about each planet by clicking on 'Your Stats' in the dropdown menu and entering some information.

SPACE-OUT was built in five days.

### Learning Goals & Requirements

1.  Solidify core React & Redux principles and gaining familiarity with Redux's new structure.
2.  Use react-router to build an app with multiple 'pages' and smooth navigation.
3.  Continue to use fetch to pull information from an API of our choice.
4.  Write effective tests using Jest/Enzyme, including on asynchronous processes.
5.  Handling of errors.
6.  Practice modular organization of files.


##  Installation

1.  clone this repo to your local machine
2.  run npm install to download all necessay dependencies
3.  run ```npm start``` to run the server
4.  open localhost:3000 (unless your terminal says otherwise)
5.  experiment with the different functionalities & see how much you would weigh on the various planets surfaces!
